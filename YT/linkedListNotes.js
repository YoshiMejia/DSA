// A linked list is a sequential collection of elements. 
// each element is called a node and each node has 2 pieces of info-- the data value itself and a pointer that references the next node in the list. the linked list has a head and a tail.
// the head node points to the second node which points to the third and so on until we reach the tail which points to null
